# ByondYoutube

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Experiment

Tailwind - [(Tailwind)](https://tailwindcss.com/) : A Utility-First CSS Framework

Rendertron [(Rendertron)](https://render-tron.appspot.com/) : Rendertron renders requested pages using Headless Chrome, auto-detecting when your PWA has completed loading and serializes the response back to the original request. 

> Experimented with rendertron as an alternative to Angular Universal. The hosted version is not stable for production use, it's advisable to host your own instance
